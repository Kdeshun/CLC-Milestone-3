Requirements

Review the project requirements within the "CST-339 CLC Project Overview," located in Class Resources. For this milestone, complete each section below, as well as update the design report.

Main Application Module

The main application, at this point, should have final styles, fonts, colors, and an overall application theme implemented that will be used for the remaining milestone deliverables.
Login Module                                                                               

The module should be refactored to use Spring Beans, Spring Core, and the DI for your business services. No database is required and authenticating a user can be emulated (hardwired in the code).
Registration Module

The module should be refactored to use Spring Beans, Spring Core, and the DI for your business services. No database is required, and the entered registration data does not have to be persisted.
Product Creation Module

The menu system should allow a user to create a new "product."
A product creation module should be implemented using Spring MVC with all the proper data validation.
A product object model should be designed and implemented.
A database model should be designed, but an implementation is not required until Milestone 4. No database is required, and the entered product data does not have to be persisted.
Note: All pages must be designed using one or more common Thymeleaf layouts.

Review and Documentation

It is expected that the team will perform peer code reviews on all code.
It is expected that the team will fully document all code modules, classes, methods, and use inline comments for all code.
It is expected that the team will meet with the instructor if there are project management issues.
